This is my current I3 Config for my laptop, and used for development. Still based off my older i3 configs, but very small changes to schemes. 
To use rofi colors, edit config to point towards colors-rofi-dark.rasi.

# References

* Font: Tamsyn
* Bottom Bar: Stock i3 with Conky
* Wallpaper: Stolen from 4walled.cc
* Distro : Fedora 29
* Terminal : Terminator
* Dmenu : Rofi

Feel free to use this and modify it however you want. Note, there are lots of dependancies that need to be installed, such as:

* i3 gaps
* Conky
* Rofi
* Pywal

And more I cant really think of at the moment.
